# Niko Soko - Service Finder App

This is a single-page application for finding and connecting with local service providers, built with React and Tailwind CSS.

## Running the Project Locally

This project is built with modern web technologies and does not require a complex build setup to run for development.

1.  **No Installation Needed:** All dependencies like React and Tailwind CSS are loaded directly from a CDN via ES modules in the `index.html` file.
2.  **Serve the Directory:** To run the app, you just need a simple local HTTP server.
    *   **Using Python:** If you have Python installed, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:
        ```sh
        # For Python 3
        python -m http.server
        ```
    *   **Using VS Code:** If you use Visual Studio Code, you can install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension. Once installed, right-click on `index.html` and choose "Open with Live Server".
3.  **Access the App:** Open your web browser and navigate to the local address provided by your server (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
